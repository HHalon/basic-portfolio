                    <p>My name is Halon Hamilton. I was born and raised in Austin Texas, and like many Texans I am proud of it. I havent always lived in Texas though, because right after highschool I enlisted into the U.S. Navy.
                        In the Navy I had the wonderful opportunity to be stationed in Japan for three years. In those three years I was exposed to Japanese culture and hospitality. My favorite part about the Japanese 
                        culture would most defintly be about how influenced by tech Japan is.

                        After my time in the Navy, it was time to start my career as a developer. Which is why I signed up for UT coding bootcamp where I can soak up as much information that I can about become a developer.
